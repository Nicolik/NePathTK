# NePathTK

**NePathTK (NephroPathology Toolkit)** is a powerful open-source end-to-end pipeline integrated with 
[QuPath](https://github.com/qupath/qupath),
enabling accurate multistain and multicompartment segmentation for decision support in nephropathology and 
large-scale analysis of kidney biopsies.  
NePathTK enables the automatic segmentation and quantification of relevant tissue structures from kidney biopsies, also in the presence of severely damaged
histological traits as in the case of thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA). 
Furthermore, the tool can be used to recognize, at instance-level,
the occurrence of TMA, hence working as an effective screening tool for this subtle and rare pathology.
